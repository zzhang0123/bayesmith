"""Spectral diagnostics for matrix-free symmetric operators.

An iterative solver can cheaply report ``‖M x - b‖``; what a caller actually
wants is ``‖x - x*‖``. The two differ by the condition number, so an honest
convergence guard over a matrix-free operator needs the ends of its spectrum,
and needs them without ever forming a matrix.

Everything here takes the operator as a callable and works on pytrees, so it
knows nothing about :mod:`bayesmith.exact.block`'s blocks and nothing about
graphs. That keeps the numerics separable from the model machinery and the
dependency pointing one way.

Ported from ``rheplicant.inference.conditioning``.
