"""How far an iterative optimiser is from the minimum, and when to ask.

Everything here takes a real-valued objective ``f`` over a pytree of arrays
and nothing else: no model, no data, no parameter names. It answers two
questions a block-coordinate or alternating optimiser cannot answer from its
own iterates.

**Where am I?** :func:`decrement` computes the Newton decrement
``lambda = sqrt(g^T H^-1 g)`` at a point, for ``g`` and ``H`` the gradient and
Hessian of ``f`` there. Near a minimum ``f`` is quadratic and
``f - f* = lambda**2 / 2``, so ``lambda`` is the distance to the minimum in
units of the curvature's own standard deviation -- which does not grow with
the number of terms in ``f`` and does not care which coordinates are slow.
A tolerance on the CHANGE of ``f`` between iterations answers neither: it is
relative to ``|f|``, and the contraction it can be extrapolated at is the
fastest mode still moving, so a slow mode hidden under a fast one passes.

**Can I trust the number?** The Hessian is never formed from the model --
every product is ``jax.jvp`` of ``jax.grad`` -- and the linear solve behind
``H^-1 g`` is inexact. :class:`Decrement` therefore carries an upper bound,
not only an estimate. With ``r = g - H x`` the true residual of the computed
``x`` and ``mu`` a LOWER bound on the smallest eigenvalue of ``H``,

    lambda  <=  (R + sqrt(R**2 + 4 g^T x)) / 2,      R = |r| / sqrt(mu)

by Cauchy-Schwarz in the ``H^-1`` inner product (``lambda**2 - g^T x = g^T
H^-1 r <= lambda R``), inflated by ``1 / sqrt(1 - eps kappa)`` for the
rounding of ``g`` and ``H`` themselves. :meth:`Decrement.certifies` reads
that bound, so an inexact solve can only make a verdict refuse.

**Everything turns on that lower bound, and only a proof will do.** A
:class:`Decrement` says where its floor came from, and
:meth:`Decrement.certifies` answers ``True`` for two of the three:

* ``"dense"`` -- the formed Hessian's own smallest eigenvalue, computed (up
  to :data:`DENSE_MAX` parameters). It also decides positive definiteness.
* ``"supplied"`` -- the caller's ``floor=``, which is a CLAIM the caller must
  be able to prove. A model with proper Gaussian priors can: ``H = J^T N^-1 J
  + P`` is bounded below by the prior precision ``P`` whenever the map is
  linear in every parameter jointly and the noise does not depend on it.
* ``"probe"`` -- a :data:`PROBE_STEPS`-step Lanczos probe of ``H``, whose
  Ritz interval is an ESTIMATE and not a bound. ``theta[0] - beta |s[0]|``
  says how far ``theta[0]`` is from SOME eigenvalue, not from the smallest,
  so where the Krylov space never reaches the bottom of the spectrum the
  probe's floor can sit above it: measured over 480 random spectra, 5 in 240
  did in float32, the worst by a factor 7.4. A probe therefore never
  certifies here. It still refuses -- non-positive curvature, or a bound
  already outside the caller's limit -- which is what it is kept for.

``"none"`` is the fourth value: no usable floor at all -- the dense path's
smallest eigenvalue was not positive, or the probe's interval did not clear
zero -- which is a refusal by itself.

**Getting there.** :func:`polish` takes Newton steps -- a Steihaug-truncated
conjugate-gradient direction, an Armijo backtracking line search, and each
step kept only if it lowers ``f`` -- which is what removes a first-order
optimiser's step-size floor before the decrement is asked.

**When to ask.** A decrement costs a gradient and a solve, so
:func:`settled`, :func:`gap_step` and :func:`change_program` are the cheap
tests that pick the iterations worth spending one on. They schedule; none of
them certifies.

**Where this came from, and what was checked before it moved.** Lifted from
``rheplicant.inference.certify`` at ``e1acb6f`` (T-004 half B), byte for byte:
the module took plain callables and pytrees and imported nothing from that
package, so there was nothing to adapt. Its 50 unit tests came with it, as
``tests/test_certify.py``. The acceptance test that drives a whole estimate to
its MAP stays upstream, because it needs that package's models.

It arrived having been through five independent reviews there. What they
established, recorded here because a reader of THIS repository cannot see
them: the bound's derivation holds; both proven floors were attacked
row by row (over four model families at 1200 latents, every claimed lower
bound sat below the true smallest eigenvalue); a zero gradient and a singular
Hessian refuse on both the dense and the conjugate-gradient path; and 23
mutants were each killed by a named assertion. The probe's unsoundness as a
floor is the measurement in the list above and is why :meth:`Decrement.
certifies` reads :data:`PROVEN_FLOORS` rather than the floor's value.

Limits. The decrement is a statement about the quadratic model of ``f`` at
the point, so where the curvature changes over one unit of distance it is
local. Above :data:`DENSE_MAX` parameters with no ``floor``, nothing here
certifies: the probe is a heuristic, and a direction of negative curvature
that neither it nor the Krylov space meets is not seen. In a precision
whose epsilon times ``kappa`` approaches one, the gradient and the Hessian
are rounding and nothing here recovers them; the status says so instead.
