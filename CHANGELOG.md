# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-26

First release. Published so that downstream packages can declare a dependency
on it by name rather than by path; until now the version was `0.0.0` and the
package was not on any index.

### What it does

- **Graph core.** Deterministic and probabilistic nodes, plates, and the joint
  log-density assembled from them.
- **NumPyro bridge.** Any graph is runnable through NUTS, which is also the
  oracle every exact path is verified against.
- **Structural dispatch** with the linear-Gaussian exact solves: conjugate,
  Wiener, GCR and GLS, selected per subgraph, with declarations such as
  `linear_in` checked at three scales rather than trusted.
- **Exact enumeration of discrete latents** (`bayesmith.exact.discrete`),
  reading the `Discrete(n)` support declaration. Not yet dispatcher-selected —
  see the README's Status section.
- **Streaming evidence** as square-root information factors, combined exactly
  across epochs.
- **Graph diagnostics**: identifiability, prior sensitivity, linearity.
- **Per-parameter convergence diagnostics** on chain paths: split r-hat and ESS
  per coordinate, gated ESS-first because a fixed r-hat threshold is not a
  well-posed test — see `r_hat_ceiling`'s docstring for the measurements.

### Known limits

- Forward-backward for chain-structured discrete latents is not implemented.
- Discrete enumeration is not yet chosen by the dispatcher.
- The API may move; this is an alpha release.
