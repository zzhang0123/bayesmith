"""The convergence certificates, on plain callables.

Unit tests for :mod:`bayesmith.optimize.certify`. Every objective here is
written in the test and every distance is checked against dense linear
algebra, because the module under test knows nothing about models, plans or
parameter names and neither does this file: the only import from the package
is the module itself.

The acceptance tests that drive the same machinery through a real plan, on
models whose MAP is known in closed form, stayed in rheplicant with the plan
they need (``tests/inference/test_estimate_reaches_map.py`` and its
neighbours); they are not in this repository and this file does not stand in
for them. What bayesmith adds on its own side is
``tests/test_optimize_certificate.py``, which drives the certificate through
:func:`~bayesmith.optimize.minimize` and :func:`~bayesmith.optimize.fit`.

Distances are in units of the curvature's standard deviation, which for a
negative log posterior is the posterior sigma. The module's default threshold
stands for 0.1 of them, ``2 * 0.005`` in the units of the objective.
